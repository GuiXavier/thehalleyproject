# Halley's Comet Countdown

This website provides a **real-time countdown** to the **next perihelion** (closest approach) of **Halley's Comet** on **July 28, 2061**. The countdown updates every second and shows the **time remaining** in **years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds**.

## Features

- **Countdown Timer**: Tracks the time remaining until Halley's Comet returns in 2061.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The countdown updates every second to give the most accurate time remaining.
- **Simple Design**: A clean and minimal design using the **Times New Roman** font, resembling scientific documentation.

## How It Works

The website uses JavaScript to calculate the **time difference** between the current date and the target date (July 28, 2061). It updates the **countdown timer** on the page to show the number of **years, days, hours, minutes, and seconds** remaining until Halley's Comet returns.

## Usage

Once you open the site in your browser, you will see the **countdown timer** showing the time remaining until the **next perihelion** of Halley's Comet, which is expected on **July 28, 2061**.
