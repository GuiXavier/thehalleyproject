    <h1>History of Halley's Comet</h1>

    <h2>A Celestial Icon Through Millennia</h2>
    <p>
      Comet 1P/Halley, universally known as Halley's Comet, stands as the most renowned of all periodic comets, a celestial wanderer that has graced Earth's skies and captivated human imagination for millennia. <a href="#ref1" class="citation-link">[1]</a> Its regular appearances, typically every 75 to 76 years, make it a unique phenomenon: a naked-eye comet that many individuals might witness twice in their lifetime. <a href="#ref2" class="citation-link">[2]</a> This predictable rhythm has allowed Halley's Comet to serve as an extraordinary temporal marker in human history, its returns punctuating different eras and offering a mirror to the evolution of our understanding of the cosmos. <a href="#ref3" class="citation-link">[3]</a> From being interpreted as a divine omen in ancient civilizations to becoming a prime subject for Newtonian physics and, eventually, a target for sophisticated robotic spacecraft, the story of Halley's Comet is inextricably linked with the advancement of human knowledge. <a href="#ref4" class="citation-link">[4]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The official designation "1P/Halley" is itself a testament to its pivotal role in the annals of science. The "P" signifies its periodic nature, returning to the inner solar system at regular intervals, while the "1" denotes its distinction as the very first comet whose periodicity was scientifically established and successfully predicted. <a href="#ref5" class="citation-link">[5]</a> This was the groundbreaking achievement of English astronomer Edmond Halley, whose work transformed comets from unpredictable portents into celestial bodies governed by the discernible laws of physics. <a href="#ref6" class="citation-link">[6]</a> This report embarks on a comprehensive journey through the multifaceted history of Comet 1P/Halley, exploring its earliest recorded sightings, the scientific revolution sparked by Halley's insights, its profound cultural impact as reflected in art and societal reactions, the wealth of knowledge gleaned from modern scientific investigations, and the anticipation surrounding its future returns. <a href="#ref7" class="citation-link">[7]</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Ancient Whispers: Early Encounters and Interpretations</h2>
    <p>
      Long before Edmond Halley deciphered its celestial mechanics, Comet 1P/Halley was a recurring spectacle for ancient civilizations, its appearances meticulously recorded, often with a mixture of awe and trepidation. <a href="#ref8" class="citation-link">[8]</a> The earliest definitively confirmed sighting dates back to 240 BCE, documented by Chinese astronomers in chronicles such as the Shih Chi and Wen Hsien Tung Khao. <a href="#ref9" class="citation-link">[9]</a> These ancient observers described it vividly as a "broom star" (彗星, huixing) or, in earlier texts, a "bushy star" (孛星, beixing), a descriptive consistency across cultures that points to the universal human response to its striking visual form, particularly its prominent tail. <a href="#ref9" class="citation-link">[9]</a> The very act of such detailed record-keeping, even when intertwined with astrological interpretations, marked a crucial early step from passive wonder towards a more systematic observation of the heavens, laying a foundation of data that would prove invaluable centuries later. <a href="#ref10" class="citation-link">[10]</a> <a href="#ref11" class="citation-link">[11]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Babylonian astronomers also left their mark, inscribing observations of the comet's apparitions in 164 BCE and 87 BCE on cuneiform tablets. <a href="#ref12" class="citation-link">[12]</a> These astronomical diaries, though often fragmentary, reveal a sophisticated practice of sky-mapping. <a href="#ref13" class="citation-link">[13]</a> One such tablet from 164 BCE describes the comet's trajectory: "The comet which previously had appeared in the east in the path of Anu in the area of Pleiades and Taurus, to the west [...] and passed along in the path of Ea". <a href="#ref14" class="citation-link">[14]</a> Further east, there is compelling, though not definitively proven, evidence suggesting an even earlier sighting by Greek observers around 466 BCE. <a href="#ref14" class="citation-link">[14]</a> Ancient Greek texts describe a "huge fiery body" visible in the sky for 75 days, an event that coincided with a significant meteorite fall in the Hellespont region. <a href="#ref15" class="citation-link">[15]</a> The correlation of this description with the projected orbit of Halley's Comet, proposed by modern researchers, exemplifies the intricate process of historical astronomical reconstruction, blending textual analysis with complex orbital mechanics and statistical validation. <a href="#ref16" class="citation-link">[16]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Roman chroniclers, too, noted the comet's passage. The historian Flavius Josephus, for instance, described the 66 CE apparition as a "star resembling a sword" hanging over Jerusalem, widely interpreted as a dire portent of the city's subsequent destruction by the Romans. <a href="#ref17" class="citation-link">[17]</a> This interpretation as an omen – often of doom, war, the death of rulers, or natural disasters – was a pervasive theme across cultures. The comet of 451 CE was linked to the defeat of Attila the Hun, and in 837 CE, its appearance reportedly filled the Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious with such dread for his own downfall that he engaged in extensive fasting and prayer. <a href="#ref18" class="citation-link">[18]</a> These ancient encounters, steeped in mythological and astrological beliefs, nevertheless provided the crucial observational bedrock upon which later scientific understanding would be built. <a href="#ref19" class="citation-link">[19]</a>
    </p>

    <h2>The Scientific Awakening: Edmond Halley and the Laws of Motion</h2>
    <p>
      For centuries, the nature of comets remained shrouded in mystery and superstition. <a href="#ref20" class="citation-link">[20]</a> The prevailing Aristotelian view held that comets were atmospheric phenomena, mere exhalations within Earth's vicinity. <a href="#ref21" class="citation-link">[21]</a> A significant step towards a scientific understanding came in 1577 when the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, through meticulous parallax measurements of a bright comet, demonstrated that these objects were far beyond the Moon, firmly placing them in the celestial realm. <a href="#ref22" class="citation-link">[22]</a> Brahe even speculated that comets might return periodically. <a href="#ref23" class="citation-link">[23]</a> His contemporary, Peter Apian, observing the comet of 1531 (later identified as Halley's), noted that cometary tails consistently pointed away from the Sun. <a href="#ref23" class="citation-link">[23]</a> Johannes Kepler, renowned for his laws of planetary motion, however, initially posited that comets traveled in straight lines. <a href="#ref24" class="citation-link">[24]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The true scientific awakening regarding comets arrived with the work of the English polymath Edmond Halley (1656-1742). <a href="#ref25" class="citation-link">[25]</a> A contemporary and friend of Sir Isaac Newton, Halley was an accomplished astronomer, mathematician, and physicist who had made significant contributions, including cataloging southern stars and observing the 1682 passage of a bright comet. <a href="#ref26" class="citation-link">[26]</a> Armed with Newton's recently formulated laws of motion and universal gravitation, Halley embarked on a systematic study of cometary orbits. <a href="#ref27" class="citation-link">[27]</a> In his seminal 1705 publication, A Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets, he presented his calculations for 24 comets. <a href="#ref28" class="citation-link">[28]</a> He noted striking similarities in the orbital elements of the comets observed in 1531, 1607, and 1682, leading him to the audacious conclusion that these were not three separate objects, but rather the same comet returning periodically. <a href="#ref29" class="citation-link">[29]</a> Based on this, Halley famously predicted its return, estimating it would appear again in late 1758 or early 1759. <a href="#ref30" class="citation-link">[30]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Edmond Halley did not live to witness the vindication of his prediction, having passed away in 1742. <a href="#ref18" class="citation-link">[18]</a> On Christmas Day 1758, a German farmer and amateur astronomer, Johann Georg Palitzsch, became the first to re-sight the comet, precisely as Halley had foretold. <a href="#ref30" class="citation-link">[30]</a> This successful prediction was a monumental triumph for Newtonian physics and the power of the scientific method. <a href="#ref31" class="citation-link">[31]</a> It irrefutably demonstrated that comets were not erratic apparitions but predictable members of the solar system, their paths governed by the same gravitational laws that dictate planetary motion. <a href="#ref32" class="citation-link">[32]</a> This achievement had profound implications, significantly diminishing the sway of superstition and heralding a new era of celestial mechanics. <a href="#ref33" class="citation-link">[33]</a> In honor of his groundbreaking insight, the French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille formally named the comet after Halley. <a href="#ref34" class="citation-link">[34]</a> The naming itself was significant; it celebrated theoretical understanding and predictive power over mere observation, recognizing that Halley had "intellectually tamed" the comet. <a href="#ref35" class="citation-link">[35]</a> The 1759 perihelion passage, slightly later than Halley's initial estimate due to the gravitational perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn (a retardation of 618 days <a href="#ref12" class="citation-link">[12]</a>), also underscored the complexities of celestial mechanics. <a href="#ref36" class="citation-link">[36]</a> This spurred further refinements in orbital calculations, exemplified by the work of Alexis Clairaut, Jérôme Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute, who meticulously computed these planetary influences for this very return. <a href="#ref37" class="citation-link">[37]</a> This iterative cycle of theory, prediction, observation, and refinement remains a cornerstone of scientific progress. <a href="#ref38" class="citation-link">[38]</a>
    </p>

    <h2>A Comet's Journey Through History: Notable Apparitions</h2>
    <p>
      Halley's Comet has woven itself into the fabric of human history, its appearances often coinciding with, and being linked to, significant terrestrial events. <a href="#ref39" class="citation-link">[39]</a> Each return offered a new lens through which humanity viewed the cosmos, reflecting the prevailing cultural and scientific understanding of the time. <a href="#ref40" class="citation-link">[40]</a>
    </p>

    <h3>1066 CE: The Norman Conquest and the Bayeux Tapestry</h3>
    <p>
      Perhaps one of the most famous historical associations is the comet's appearance in 1066 CE, shortly before the pivotal Battle of Hastings. <a href="#ref41" class="citation-link">[41]</a> This event is immortalized in the Bayeux Tapestry, a remarkable embroidered cloth narrating the Norman Conquest of England. <a href="#ref41" class="citation-link">[41]</a> A section of the tapestry vividly depicts the comet, a "star with hair," with onlookers, including King Harold II, gazing upwards in apprehension. <a href="#ref42" class="citation-link">[42]</a> The Latin inscription reads "ISTI MIRANT STELLA" - "They marvel at the star". <a href="#ref42" class="citation-link">[42]</a> For the Anglo-Saxons under King Harold, it was widely interpreted as a dire omen, a harbinger of misfortune. <a href="#ref42" class="citation-link">[42]</a> Conversely, for William the Conqueror and his Norman invaders, the celestial visitor was seen as a favorable sign, a divine endorsement of their campaign. <a href="#ref43" class="citation-link">[43]</a> The 11th-century Benedictine monk Eilmer of Malmesbury is recorded to have said upon seeing the comet: "You've come, have you? - You've come, you source of tears to many mothers. It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my country". <a href="#ref43" class="citation-link">[43]</a>

    <h3>1456 CE: Siege of Belgrade and the Papal Bull Myth</h3>
    <p>
      The 1456 apparition coincided with another period of intense geopolitical turmoil: the Ottoman Empire's advance into Europe and the critical Siege of Belgrade. <a href="#ref9" class="citation-link">[9]</a> <a href="#ref44" class="citation-link">[44]</a> This return is associated with a persistent, though apocryphal, story that Pope Callixtus III "excommunicated" the comet, viewing it as an evil portent for the Christian defenders. <a href="#ref44" class="citation-link">[44]</a> However, historical research has debunked this myth. <a href="#ref45" class="citation-link">[45]</a> Primary sources, including the papal bull issued by Callixtus III on June 29, 1456, reveal that the Pope called for prayers for the defenders of Belgrade and for divine intervention against the Ottoman threat, but made no mention of the comet itself. <a href="#ref45" class="citation-link">[45]</a> The tale of the comet's excommunication appears to have originated in a posthumous biography of the Pope written in 1475 and was later popularized by figures such as Pierre-Simon Laplace. <a href="#ref45" class="citation-link">[45]</a> This episode serves as a valuable illustration of how historical narratives can evolve and diverge from documented facts, emphasizing the importance of critical source analysis.
    </p>

    <h3>1835 CE: Early Scientific Scrutiny and Cultural Echoes</h3>
    <p>
      By its 1835 return, Halley's Comet was met with more organized scientific scrutiny, reflecting the advancements in astronomical instrumentation and theory. <a href="#ref46" class="citation-link">[46]</a> Astronomers like François Arago in France made significant observations, confirming the polarization of light from the comet's tail and studying the "plumes" or jets emanating from the nucleus. <a href="#ref47" class="citation-link">[47]</a> In Germany, Friedrich Bessel meticulously observed these jets, correctly suggesting they were material ejected from the nucleus by solar heating and then repelled by the Sun to form the tail. <a href="#ref47" class="citation-link">[47]</a> This apparition also occurred shortly after the invention of the daguerreotype, and while direct photographic evidence from 1835 is elusive, the era marked the dawn of astronomical photography. <a href="#ref47" class="citation-link">[47]</a> Culturally, the 1835 return resonated widely. It coincided with the birth of American writer Mark Twain, who famously quipped he "came in with Halley's Comet" and expected to "go out with it" (a prediction fulfilled with his death shortly after the 1910 perihelion). <a href="#ref48" class="citation-link">[48]</a> Commemorative items, such as Halley's Comet pins and brooches, became fashionable, particularly in the Georgian style. <a href="#ref48" class="citation-link">[48]</a> Despite growing scientific understanding, old fears lingered, and the comet's appearance was still linked by some to disasters and fueled apocalyptic anxieties, such as those associated with the Millerite movement in America. <a href="#ref48" class="citation-link">[48]</a>
    </p>

    <h3>1910 CE: A Spectacle of Awe and Anxiety</h3>
    <p>
      The 1910 apparition of Halley's Comet was a truly global event, marked by both scientific advancement and widespread public hysteria. <a href="#ref49" class="citation-link">[49]</a> The comet made a relatively close approach to Earth, and its spectacular tail was visible to the naked eye for several weeks. <a href="#ref50" class="citation-link">[50]</a> This was the first return for which extensive photographic records were made, with observatories like the Lowell Observatory capturing detailed images. <a href="#ref50" class="citation-link">[50]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this apparition is perhaps most remembered for the "Great Comet Panic of 1910". <a href="#ref51" class="citation-link">[51]</a> The panic was ignited by a combination of new scientific discoveries and their sensationalized reporting. <a href="#ref51" class="citation-link">[51]</a> Astronomers at the Yerkes Observatory, using the then-novel technique of spectroscopy, detected the presence of cyanogen gas (CN₂), a toxic compound, in the comet's tail. <a href="#ref52" class="citation-link">[52]</a> <a href="#ref53" class="citation-link">[53]</a> While the actual concentration of the gas in the vastness of the tail posed no threat to Earth, this discovery was amplified by the media and fueled by speculative, and at times irresponsible, statements from prominent astronomers like Camille Flammarion of France. <a href="#ref53" class="citation-link">[53]</a> <a href="#ref54" class="citation-link">[54]</a> Flammarion and others mused about the theoretical possibility of the cyanogen "impregnating the atmosphere and possibly snuffing out all life on the planet," or other dire consequences like the atmosphere being stripped of oxygen by cometary hydrogen, or global floods triggered by X-rays from the tail. <a href="#ref54" class="citation-link">[54]</a> <a href="#ref55" class="citation-link">[55]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Public reaction was dramatic. Fear of poisoning led to a rush for "anti-comet pills" (often made of sugar and quinine), gas masks, and even instances of people sealing their homes or seeking refuge in wells. <a href="#ref55" class="citation-link">[55]</a> Some, with more entrepreneurial spirit, sold "comet insurance" or threw "comet parties" to either exploit or mock the fear. <a href="#ref56" class="citation-link">[56]</a> Tragically, there were also reports of suicides attributed to the panic. <a href="#ref57" class="citation-link">[57]</a> <a href="#ref58" class="citation-link">[58]</a> The 1910 event starkly illustrated the complex interplay between scientific discovery, media responsibility, and public understanding of science—a dynamic that remains highly relevant in contemporary society. <a href="#ref58" class="citation-link">[58]</a> Beyond cyanogen, spectroscopy in 1910 began to reveal more about cometary composition, confirming the presence of dust and other gases, building upon the 19th-century understanding that comets were largely "rocks and dust". <a href="#ref59" class="citation-link">[59]</a> <a href="#ref60" class="citation-link">[60]</a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Today, Halley's Comet is studied not only for its beauty, but also for what it teaches us about the early solar system.
