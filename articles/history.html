    <h1>History of Halley's Comet</h1>

    <p>
      Halley's Comet is the most famous periodic comet, visible from Earth every 75–76 years.
      Its first recorded appearance dates back to 240 BCE in Chinese chronicles, although it likely appeared long before that without formal documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The comet was named after English astronomer <strong>Edmond Halley</strong>, who in 1705 used Newton's laws to predict that the comet seen in 1682 would return in 1758.
      Although Halley did not live to see it, the comet reappeared as he predicted—solidifying his legacy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Halley's Comet has had many spectacular returns, including the one in <strong>1910</strong>, which passed so close to Earth that its tail was visible to the naked eye for several weeks.
      The most recent appearance was in <strong>1986</strong>, and the next is expected in <strong>2061</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout history, its appearance has often been linked to superstitions, wars, and major events, including the fall of empires.
      Today, Halley's Comet is studied not only for its beauty, but also for what it teaches us about the early solar system.
